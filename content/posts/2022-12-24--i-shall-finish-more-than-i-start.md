Here’s an incomplete list of projects I’m working on right now in my “spare time”, in order from least abandoned to most.

1. This very blog you’re reading
2. [Migrating everything off LastPass][lastpass breach], because it seems it’s very overdue
3. Setting up NixOS on a new hard drive (this time it will stick, goddamnit)
4. [Advent of Code] 2022 (I’m about half-way through; turns out it’s a lot harder to keep up when you have a tiny child)
5. Improvements to [my personal Mastodon instance][mastodon.functional.computer]
6. Migrating my email and calendar from Google to Fastmail, in my quest to de-Googlify myself
7. Shipping regular expression support in [Smoke]
8. A build system as a DSL embedded in Haskell, called [The Bakery]
9. A Firefox extension which automatically deletes cookies over a certain age, called [Memory Loss]
10. Merging my other personal website, which is hopelessly out of date and therefore does not deserve a link, into this one

That seems to be about, I don’t know, seven or eight too many.

So my new year’s resolution for 2023 is: I shall finish more than I start.

Here’s to a shorter list this time next year.
