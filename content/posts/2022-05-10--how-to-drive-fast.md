An incomplete list of the things you need to drive a car at high speed:

- a powerful engine
- high-quality brakes
- power steering
- solid suspension
- tires in good repair
- a clean windshield
- a seatbelt
- an airbag
- enough fuel
- an open road
- good-quality tarmac (asphalt)
- excellent weather conditions
- clear visibility
- quick reflexes
- a solid night’s sleep
- years of experience

Next time someone asks you why you’re wasting time writing tests, or refactoring code, or introducing continuous deployment, consider this list.
