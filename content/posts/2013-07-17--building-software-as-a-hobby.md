I want to make things for everyone.

I haven't done that in a while. The last big project I did was
[eventual.ly](http://eventual.ly/), my event notification service,
similar in ideas to Facebook Events. It was really fun, but doesn't work
so well any more. (It still works, but there's some serious problems
with editing events. Use at your own peril.) Since then, there's been a
bunch of stuff appearing on [my GitHub
account](https://github.com/SamirTalwar), but hardly any of it is for
the general public. Most of it is just me dicking about.

Having a day job is great, but generally, you have customers, who might
be the most lovely people you've ever met, but they're not your friends
or family or even the people you follow on Facebook and Twitter. I want
to make software for those people. I want to build things for fun and
then watch people smile as I show them what they do. Deadlines are
pretty motivational, but I'd rather the work I do to be reward enough
that I can't *wait* to get home and get the next feature out.

And you know, the only thing stopping me is, well, me.

I'm going to program because I love it, not because I'm being paid for
it. Forget programming; I'm going to work on the entire stack, from
administering the server to drawing the logo on the web site. I'm going
to write in eight different languages I don't know very well because the
only thing that would make this better is learning new things at the
same time.

I'm really looking forward to the next few months. Hopefully, with a bit
of luck and a lot of hard work, I'll have some announcements to make.
