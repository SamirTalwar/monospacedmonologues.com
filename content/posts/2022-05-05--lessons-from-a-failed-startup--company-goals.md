In failing to build a company, I have learned many things. Core to all of them is that a company is not a product. Ideas change, products change, people change. We “pivot”, rapidly, relentlessly, sometimes ruthlessly.

Managed well, change is a catalyst. Managed badly, it can be catastrophic.

In this series, I try to explain the various ways in which I failed to understand this, and how I would endeavour to do better next time. You may notice that the style of these posts is more instructive than usual. Remember that these are mostly addressed to my future self, and as such, I am telling _myself_ what to do; you, my dear sentient being, can do whatever you want.

We have a problem to solve. We try something. We iterate. We talk to people.

It’s highly likely that upon talking to people, your vision of your product will change. This is the point. Get used to it, share your thoughts with your colleagues, and try to make sure you’re on the same page pretty often.

Sometimes, the product vision changes so much that it nudges the company in a very different direction. At Prodo, we switched, at some point, from creating ML-powered _analysis_ tools to much more straightforward _creation_ tools. I think it was probably a good decision: why cure what you can prevent?

Unfortunately, I don’t remember ever actually discussing this. It just… happened. No decisions were explicitly made.

When something this big happens, it’s natural that not all of the company founders, executives, or employees will necessarily agree on the new direction. This is reasonable. _Talk about it._ Some people may decide to leave the company at this point, including founders (maybe even you), and you need to be ready for this.

When the dust settles, it’s time to take a hard look at which roles and responsibilities need to be fulfilled in this new company. You might find you have a missing role, or overlap. In our case, we ended up with the CTO (me) and the CEO vying for control over the product’s interfaces, which caused problems for the whole organisation.

If you don’t take the time to change the company when the vision changes, it’ll change anyway. The difference is, you won’t like the change.
