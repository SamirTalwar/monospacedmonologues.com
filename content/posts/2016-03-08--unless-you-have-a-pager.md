I just found a bug in [SDKMAN!][] that you'll probably never see. It only manifested in my machine when I ran the test cases inside a Docker container.

SDKMAN! is a program that manages, well, SDKs. It started off as the Groovy Version Manager, or GVM, but now it can install multiple versions of Scala, Grails, SBTâ€¦ you name it in the Java world, and it's there. You run it with the `sdk` command in your terminal.

<!--more-->

Anyway, `sdk list` is a command that lists all available "candidates" it can install. It's a bit more complicated than this, but it essentially boils down to:

    __sdkman_list_candidates {
        echo "$(curl -s "${SDKMAN_SERVICE}/candidates/list")" | ${PAGER-less}
    }

It just hits a URL on the Internet and pipes it to your `$PAGER`, or `less` if you don't have the variable set. `less` is on pretty much every computer, so it's a safe bet.

Except when it's not.

The Docker image, `java:8`, is pretty lightweight. It has Java on it, of course, and a bunch of system utilities, but a lot of fairly basic tooling is missing. `less` included. So when you try and run the SDKMAN! tests inside a Docker container (which is encouraged), one fails because there's no pager.

So I fixed it. Instead of `less`, I defaulted `$PAGER` to `$(which less)`. `which` is a built-in shell command that finds the given executable on your `$PATH`. Inside a `java:8` container, `$PATH` looks like this:

    /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

This means that `which less` will look for a program called `less` in each of those six directories in order, then output the full path of the first one it finds. If it doesn't find one, it'll print nothing and exit with a non-zero status code (in *bash*), or sometimes print an error message as well (in *zsh*).

So if we don't have a `$PAGER` but we do have `less` in */usr/bin*, we can ask our shell to default to the latter.

    $ echo "${PAGER-$(which less)}"
    /usr/bin/less

However, if we don't have `less` at all:

    $ echo "${PAGER-$(which less)}"

Nothing. We can use that. If we set that to a variable, we can check whether the variable exists, and then only pipe to the pager if we have one:

    __sdkman_list_candidates {
        local pager="${PAGER-$(which less)}"
        if [[ -n "$pager" ]]; then
            echo "$(curl -s "${SDKMAN_SERVICE}/candidates/list")" | $pager
        else
            echo "$(curl -s "${SDKMAN_SERVICE}/candidates/list")"
        fi
    }

Sorted. The only problem is the duplication. Functions to the rescue, of course.

    __sdkman_list_candidates {
        local pager="${PAGER-$(which less)}"
        __sdkman_page echo "$(curl -s "${SDKMAN_SERVICE}/candidates/list")"
    }

    __sdkman_page {
        local pager="${PAGER-$(which less)}"
        if [[ -n "$pager" ]]; then
            "$@" | $pager
        else
            "$@"
        fi
    }

Here, we've written a function that checks whether we have a pager. If it finds one, it runs its full set of arguments (`$@`) as a command and pipes the output to the pager. If it doesn't, it simply runs the arguments as a command.

Because when you're shipping software to run on Mac OS, Linux and BSD OSes all over the world, you really can't trust that anything is as it seems.
