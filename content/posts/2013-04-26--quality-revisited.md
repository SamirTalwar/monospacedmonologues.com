Wow, that was a lot of great feedback in a few hours.

So let's talk about it.

The first thing I want to talk about is the tone of [the
piece](http://monospacedmonologues.com/post/48868525510/quality). It's
kind of idealistic. Of course, things didn't always go that smoothly,
but we aspired to meet the standards we set for ourselves. And things
were definitely improving everywhere you looked. [syl

on how the TV screens were mostly red. This is actually true at a lot of
places that measure build breakages, because keeping all 200 builds
green at all times is an absolute nightmare. Especially when a lot of
them are hitting a test web server with Internet Explorer 6 and
WebDriver, trying to break your application. You might break the
application, or you might simply break IE.

This got a lot better when we made the (painful) upgrade from Selenium 1
to Selenium 2 + WebDriver, by the way. If you're running anything
through Selenium, I wholeheartedly recommend you take the hitâ€”your
browsers will become so much more stable. When I visited TIM Group
recently, everything was looking nice and green.

[Andrew Parker
asked](https://twitter.com/aparker42/status/327611389982162944) what the
question was that prompted the piece. It was in an email from
[Ed](https://plus.google.com/111189347667024503360): "Basically I wanted
to know what process (Agile, Kanban, Waterfall???) you follow and what
tools you may use to help (JIRA, etc)? Any books/resources you can
recommend too?" I replied with an answer, but I was dissatisfied with
it, so I blew it up by a thousand words or so and made it into a blog
post.

Finally, [David Green pointed
out](https://twitter.com/activelylazy/status/327657045522276352) that
the dogma on the cost of fixing bugs has been debunked by [Laurent
Bossavit](https://twitter.com/Morendil) in his book, [The Leprechauns of
Software Engineering](https://leanpub.com/leprechauns), along with other
myths and legends. I've added it to my reading list and I'm really
looking forward to it.

Thanks so much again to everyone who retweeted, commented and gave
advice on the post. I really appreciate it.
