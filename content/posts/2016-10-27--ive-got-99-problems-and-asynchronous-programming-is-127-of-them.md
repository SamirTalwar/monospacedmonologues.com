On Monday, I gave a talk at Codemotion Berlin entitledâ€¦ well, it's a long title. I don't need to say it twice.

Anyway, [I thought you might be interested in reading it.][talk] Yes, reading it. My talks are essays first.

It's got lots of lovely buttons in it that you can click. Like this one:

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="26053" data-slug-hash="PGVpgQ" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="SamirTalwar" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/SamirTalwar/pen/PGVpgQ/">99 bottles, take 5</a> by Samir Talwar (<a href="http://codepen.io/SamirTalwar">@SamirTalwar</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
