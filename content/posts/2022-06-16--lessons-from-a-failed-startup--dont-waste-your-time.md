In failing to build a company, I have learned many things. Core to all of them is that a company is not a product. Ideas change, products change, people change. We “pivot”, rapidly, relentlessly, sometimes ruthlessly.

Managed well, change is a catalyst. Managed badly, it can be catastrophic.

In this series, I try to explain the various ways in which I failed to understand this, and how I would endeavour to do better next time. You may notice that the style of these posts is more instructive than usual. Remember that these are mostly addressed to my future self, and as such, I am telling _myself_ what to do; you, my dear original thinker, can do whatever you want.

I write software, and I thoroughly enjoy it.

Despite reading a lot of books along the lines of _The Lean Startup_, I thought that in my role in my company, I’d mostly be writing software.

This was, in hindsight, quite foolish.

Until you grok your potential customers, you don’t need any software.

Go out and talk to people. Understand their woes. Figure out what keeps them late in the office. Ask them what happened to cause their latest catastrophe, and help them conduct a root-cause analysis to truly get to the point.

Be generous with your time.

And if you can’t get in the door, that’s one more reason why you don’t need to write any code yet.

I’m finding this hard to write. I don’t want to talk to people, I want to code!

But code is not the end, it’s the means.
