On the 31st of January, 2014, I will be leaving Palantir Technologies and a job I love. I'll be leaving some of the best people I've ever met, a really cool set of products, some awesome customers and (not least) an absolutely beautiful working environment. I'll be leaving a job that's taught me about client relations, server administration, requirements gathering, large-scale data management, integration and sanitisation, but also how to work with people on different continents and how to deliver outcomes, not services or products.

At this point, you may be asking why? It's because while all of these things are important, only some of them are me. I am a software engineer, a developer, a coder. I make computers do things, specifically in ways that make sure they get that thing done well. The other stuff is incredibly valuable, but it's not what I'm best at and it's not what I love. I'm very grateful to Palantir for the experience, but it's time to refocus.

So, to that end, I'm joining [Sandro Mancuso][@sandromancuso] and [Mashooq Badar][@mashooq], two of the best developers and software craftsmen I've ever met in my time in this industry, in their brand new company, [Codurance][]. Codurance is a little different from other software shops. It focuses on building software for the long term, which is something I've focused on a lot on this blog. I have no doubt we'll fit together really well.

What this means is that I'm available for hire. If you need someone to help your team improve the maintainability and stability of a product, add test coverage to help you avoid breaking things, or even run training programs to get your developers up to scratch with the latest and greatest in Extreme Programming and Software Craftsmanship practices, get in touch.
