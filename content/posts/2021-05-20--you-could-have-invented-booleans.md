Booleans can be confusing.

_Note: The original version of this article used a tweet by [David Flanagan][@rawkode], but it's gone missing, so I have replaced it with this screenshot._

Now, let's first establish that we're glad the `file_diff` crate exists and we appreciate the maintainers for their time. This is not an accusation or criticism of their work, simply an exercise in imagining a different universe where the API of `diff` is different.

So, with that in mind, let's imagine we are reading some code that uses `diff`, and we are confused, because there' a function called "diff", short for "different", that returns `true` if the two arguments are identical, or _not_ different.

There are a couple of ways we could improve this situation for comprehensibility.

For example, we could change the logic so it returns `true` when the inputs are different (as implied by the name). That'd work, but then it'd have different behaviour to the `diff` or `git diff` programs, which exit with the code `0` (success) when the input files are identical.

Or we could rename the method `is_identical` (suggested by [St√©phane Bj√∏rne][@stebjoerne]). This would make the return value more meaningful, as we can infer from the name what `true` means.

I'd prefer not to use `true` and `false` at all.

## Semantically, what _are_ booleans, anyway?

This might seem like a strange question. Truth and falsity, as concepts, are pretty ingrained in us. It's not just computer people that use boolean logic all the time.

```
if (it's raining) {
  I pick up an umbrella on the way out ‚òîÔ∏è
}
```

```
if (it's morning || (I'm tired && not (it's bedtime))) {
  I make coffee ‚òï
} else {
  I grumble about not having had enough coffee üò´
}
```

These two examples give us a lot of information about what a boolean is, in terms of what we can _do_ with it. We can "and" (`&&`) them, "or" (`||`) them, and `not` them. (And other stuff, too.) But more importantly, we can `if` them. We can decide to do something if a boolean is `true`, and to do something else (or nothing) if the boolean is `false`.

<!--more-->

## So booleans are‚Ä¶ nothing special.

If that's what a boolean does, then‚Ä¶ we can do that. It's an enumeration, consisting of `false` and `true`.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]
pub enum Boolean {
    False,
    True,
}
```

(FYI, that `#[derive(‚Ä¶)]` stuff is just Rust-speak for "implement some boilerplate for me". This takes care of copying data, equality, and converting to a string for debugging.)

We can implement functionality, such as `and`:

```rust
use Boolean::*;

impl Boolean {
    fn and(self, other: Self) -> Self {
        match (self, other) {
            (True, True) => True,
            _ => False,
        }
    }
}
```

(I'll let you implement `not` and `or` for yourselves.)

And we can make decisions based on the result:

```rust
impl Boolean {
    pub fn decide<T>(&self, if_true: impl Fn() -> T, if_false: impl Fn() -> T) -> T {
        match self {
            False => if_false(),
            True => if_true(),
        }
    }
}
```

I've called this `decide` to avoid trying to name a function `if`, which I'm pretty sure wouldn't make the compiler happy. But modulo some syntax, it's `if` in disguise. It accepts functions (`impl Fn() -> T` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a `T`) to allow it to only evaluate one clause, not both.

If you're writing Java, you can do the same thing with subtype polymorphism instead of pattern matching, and an `enum`:

```java
public enum Bool {
  False {
    @Override
    public Bool and(Bool other) {
      return this;
    }

    @Override
    public <T> T decide(Supplier<T> ifTrue, Supplier<T> ifFalse) {
      return ifFalse.get();
    }
  },
  True {
    @Override
    public Bool and(Bool other) {
      return other;
    }

    @Override
    public <T> T decide(Supplier<T> ifTrue, Supplier<T> ifFalse) {
      return ifTrue.get();
    }
  };

  public abstract Bool and(Bool other);

  public abstract <T> T decide(Supplier<T> ifTrue, Supplier<T> ifFalse);
}
```

It's verbose, because it's Java, with the braces and the `return` or whatnot, but the implementation of `and` is pretty gorgeous in my opinion. All decision making is done by the dynamic dispatch mechanism, which means we really can implement our own `if` (or `decide`, at least).

C# doesn't have methods in enums, but you can do the same thing with an abstract class, a private constructor, and two implementing classes. (And you can do that in Java too, if you like.)

This is [exactly how Smalltalk implements booleans][smalltalk: a functional programming language]: they're simply subclasses of the `Boolean` interface with `if` methods.

## So we can make a boolean.

That's a very roundabout way of saying that booleans really aren't _core_ to any language. They're usually built in so we can wrap some pretty syntax around them in the form of `if`, `&&` and `||` (for languages that don't support operator overloading), etc., and so the compiler authors can optimise operations that have machine code equivalents. The mechanics aside, though, they could be defined in the standard library, or not at all, if we wanted.

Let's go back to the `diff` function at the start of this article. Go on, scroll up, remind yourself. I will wait.

So, here's the code we're talking about. (Reminder: this is not criticism, and I am assuming the library is pleasant to use and made by lovely people.)

```rust
file_diff::diff("./src/lib.rs", "./src/lib.rs"); // returns `true`
```

Now, we know that a boolean is really just an enum with some syntactic sugar sprinkled on top. This means that we can make our own, and it's just as valid.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]
pub enum DiffResult {
  Identical,
  Different,
}
```

Now, `bool` (and `Boolean`) and `DiffResult` are isomorphic: there's a bidirectional, one-to-one mapping. We can convert `DiffResult` to `bool` trivially: `result == DiffResult::Identical`. And we can convert back, if we really want to:

```rust
impl DiffResult {
    pub fn from_boolean(b: bool) -> Self {
        match b {
            false => Self::Different,
            true => Self::Identical,
        }
    }
}
```

Unlike using a `bool`, though, our custom type gives us _flexibility_.

For example, once we have a `DiffResult`, we might notice that returning `DiffResult::Different` when one of the input files doesn't exist seems‚Ä¶ odd. And so we might, for example, add a new case: `CouldNotReadFile(path: Path)`. (Yes, enums can have arguments in both Rust and Java.)

Once we have three cases, matching becomes a little more tough, so we might provide a helper method to get back to the boolean value:

```rust
impl DiffResult {
    pub fn is_identical(&self) -> bool {
        match self {
            Self::Identical => true,
            _ => false,
        }
    }
}
```

Now we have a named type, it becomes a _behaviour attractor_ (thanks to Corey Haines book, [Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design][], for this terminology). We now have a place to put behaviour that might previously have lived all over the place. This results in less repetition, more consistency (especially among naming), and less work when it comes to refactoring or improving behaviour.

All that said, my favourite side effect of a change such as this is not really related to code, but documentation. By moving away from _primitives_ such as "true" and "false" and towards descriptive terms, we reduce the amount of explanation necessary in the documentation. Indeed, most commentary becomes redundant, as it will end up repeating the code itself. For example, "returns `true` if the files are identical" becomes "returns `Identical` if the files are identical", which is almost unnecessary to say. Especially with statically-typed code such as the Rust shown here, a lot can be inferred just by reading the function signature. (This is not an excuse not to write documentation. Please write documentation.)

You could have invented booleans. But you don't need them.
