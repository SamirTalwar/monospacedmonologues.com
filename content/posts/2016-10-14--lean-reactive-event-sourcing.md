*a.k.a. ALL OF THE BUZZWORDS.*

You know, it's been so long I forgot how my blog works. Time to remedy that.

I gave a talk last month at DevOps Linz entitled "Staying lean with application logs". On the day, I came up with the far more click-baity one above.

<!--more-->

Long story short, it's about working with microservices in a lean fashionâ€”specifically, how to avoid a database for as long as possible. My team at Your Golf Travel ([who are hiring][Palatinate Group Careers]), including [@sleepyfox][] and me, came up with a fairly simple way of publishing events which we turned into a node.js library.

You can check it out [over on GitHub][ygt/microservice-logging].

That's the (really) short version. If you want to know more, you can [check out the talk as an essay][Staying Lean With Application Logs]. There's a link in the top-right to the slides, but the essay form will be much easier to follow. Let me know what you think in the comments!

Oh, and if you want to see the talk, [@sleepyfox][] and I will be doing it together over at [TopConf Tallinn 2016][]. We'd love to see you there. Let me know if you're coming!
