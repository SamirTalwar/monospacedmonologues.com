Last week, Twitter got new management.

Now, I’m not a fan of the new management. But then, I wasn’t a fan of the old management either. Nevertheless, this presented an opportunity to reflect on how I engage with Twitter.

About a year ago, I decided I was spending far too much time doomscrolling, and I deleted the app from my phone. I’ve done this before, but this time it stuck. I keep the browser signed out, too. If I want to check what’s going on on the timeline right now, I have to go to a computer. This means that I rarely check out the timeline. And I do not miss it.

So where’s the value? The value is in the conversations, the mutuals, the shared context we build over years. But at least for me, it’s been diminishing: the value I get out of Twitter now (or even a year ago, pre-deletion) is almost zero. I almost never receive a message from a friend that wouldn’t have been more personal somewhere more private. I see a lot of awful global news, but very rarely do I get some personal news that improves my relationship with someone.

This past weekend, I toyed with the idea of switching on Mastodon (with my own server, because what’s the point of joining someone else’s?) and trying to find my place in a community. I didn’t bother, in the end.

It’s not 2008 any more. The world has changed. It’s become more connected, for better or for worse, and I don’t think the evolution of communication platforms looks like Twitter. I think it’ll be very different.

As for me, I think I’ll keep my Twitter account around, mostly checking in occasionally to see if I have messages, but I’m done with the service. I don’t need it any more.

Perhaps I’ll join Mastodon, somewhere. Perhaps I’ll start my own server with [microblog.pub]. Mastodon uses the [ActivityPub] protocol under the hood, and it's open. You can even write your own software if you want.

But for now, well, I have this blog. It’s not going anywhere. Maybe I’ll write more often. I enjoy it. You can subscribe, you know. The web isn’t going anywhere, and RSS will work until the apocalypse.

And if I want some conversation, perhaps I’ll add some server-side support and implement a [Webmention] endpoint (which is even simpler than ActivityPub), so your blog can talk to my blog. The way Twitter was meant to be, over a decade ago.

If you want to contact me, I’m sure you can find my email address. No doomscrolling required.
