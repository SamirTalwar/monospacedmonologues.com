Today, I'm 29.

Here's what I'd like for my birthday.

I'd like you to ask yourself why you do what you do.

And then I'd like you to post that online somewhere public (even if it's bloody Facebook), and leave a link in the comments, or [email me][samir@noodlesandwich.com], or [tweet me][@SamirTalwar], orâ€¦ you get the idea.

That'd be the best present I could ask for.

I'll be doing the same, and I'll be posting it up here when I'm ready.

I don't expect this to be easy. I expect it to take a while. Maybe a week, or a month.

But if you have the time, I'd really appreciate it.

I don't promise to read it straight away. If all goes to plan I won't be anywhere near the Internet this day, and maybe not for a little while after.

I do promise I'll read it.
