In failing to build a company, I have learned many things. Core to all of them is that a company is not a product. Ideas change, products change, people change. We “pivot”, rapidly, relentlessly, sometimes ruthlessly.

Managed well, change is a catalyst. Managed badly, it can be catastrophic.

In this series, I try to explain the various ways in which I failed to understand this, and how I would endeavour to do better next time. You may notice that the style of these posts is more instructive than usual. Remember that these are mostly addressed to my future self, and as such, I am telling _myself_ what to do; you, my dear thinking meatbag, can do whatever you want.

Not gonna lie, I love me some sticky notes on the wall. I adore test-driving code. I want to pair on pretty much everything, including drinking coffee. (My morning coffee with my partner is mandatory.) I love retrospectives. I think the daily standup can be an inspiring start to the morning (when it’s not conducted over <small>fucking</small> Zoom with everyone’s camera turned off).

All these methods are just that, _methods_, not results. They don’t achieve anything by themselves. They’re all enablers to help you _iterate_ frequently (and at a sustainable pace), with high-quality, actionable feedback.

Use them, by all means, but use them to iterate. You don’t need to polish the internals of an app you’re 80% likely to throw it out. Test-drive the code, if it helps you achieve your goal, but if your goal is a demo, remember that. Write tests around the parts that _must_ work, and test the rest manually if it’s faster to do so.

Reflect, of course, but focus your reflection. Maybe instead of a retrospective every week, you need one after every customer sales demo. If you have no feedback, there’s not much to talk about.

You have many tools in your toolbox. Choose the tools that will help you ship the thing you intend to ship, when you intend to ship it.
