# Docker, Part Eleven: Cleaning House

We've come a long way, but as they say, you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs.

Lets have a look at the mess I've made in the last couple of days.

    $ docker images

Welp. That's a lot of images. Let's take a look at the processes.

    $ docker ps -a

Huh. What about the volumes and networks?

    $ docker network ls
    NETWORK ID          NAME                      DRIVER
    d5f0b701f820        bemorerandomcom_default   bridge

    local               artifactory-backup

There's a lot of old containers, old imagesâ€¦ you get the idea.

## Cleaning Up Processes

Let's take a look at the processes first. We probably don't need to keep around exited containers. While you may want to restart containers, I find it's generally better to assume they're transient and keep anything you really need around in volumes. So let's `docker rm` them all.

First of all, let's get a list of just the exited ones.

    $ docker ps -a -f status=exited
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
    f8cac2b6a910        bemorerandomcom_init-db   "/docker-entrypoint.s"   About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       bemorerandomcom_init-db_1
    4352c0fb03f2        e91988c244d5              "/bin/sh -c ./web-ser"   11 minutes ago       Exited (130) 10 minutes ago                         hopeful_jepsen
    ...

Brilliant. We can now just get the IDs.

    $ docker ps -a -f status=exited -q
    f8cac2b6a910
    4352c0fb03f2
    ...

And now we can delete them all by piping them to `docker rm`. This command takes container names or IDs on the command line, just like `rm`, so we'll use `xargs` to convert standard input to arguments.

    $ docker ps -a -f status=exited -q | xargs docker rm

## Removing Old Images

Next up are the images. We can do pretty much the same thing, by asking for a list of dangling images:

    $ docker images -f dangling=true
    REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    <none>              <none>              9fbf9a59988f        18 minutes ago      1.114 MB
    <none>              <none>              c22ec25253af        19 minutes ago      1.114 MB
    <none>              <none>              ebbf152e136f        19 minutes ago      1.114 MB
    <none>              <none>              034202381eca        19 minutes ago      1.114 MB
    <none>              <none>              ec5891ebc3f9        19 minutes ago      1.114 MB
    <none>              <none>              e91988c244d5        33 minutes ago      1.114 MB
    <none>              <none>              9483181fd50d        3 hours ago         643.2 MB
    <none>              <none>              ab091b02e41d        9 months ago        2.434 MB

Then we just pipe it to `docker rmi`:

    $ docker images -f dangling=true -q | xargs docker rmi

## Cleaning Up Networks

Networks don't often get created by accident, so I'd like to leave those alone for now. The best advice I can give you is to check the list every now and again and run `docker network rm` to remove the extras.

## Trashing Expired Volumes

Volumes can be created in one of three ways:

  1. we've created it explicitly with `docker volume create`,
  2. we bound a volume but didn't give it a target with the `-v` flag, passed to `docker run`, or
  3. the image we're using specifies that a certain directory must be mounted as a volume.

I operate on a simple policy: if I care about the data, I name the volume. If I don't care, I don't bother. This allows me to easily distinguish between the volumes I care about and the one's I don't: the volumes I didn't create have names that consist of 64 characters of hexadecimal.

Just like images, `docker volume ls` can take a filter to find only volumes that are unattached to any container (including stopped containers):

    $ docker volume ls -f dangling=true
    DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
    local               bemorerandomcom_postgresql
    local               6328ee0027c6d461ff15149fc073e020b0c200e1b9c2ef6e35993e1677dda573

Next, we can just get the name, and filter out anything that isn't randomly generated with a simple regex[^simple regex]:

    $ docker volume ls -f dangling=true -q | awk '$0 ~ "^[0-9a-f]{64}$"'
    6328ee0027c6d461ff15149fc073e020b0c200e1b9c2ef6e35993e1677dda573

That `awk` expression compares each line to the regular expression `^[0-9a-f]{64}$`, which only matches if the string is exactly 64 characters, consisting only of `0-9` and `a-f`.

Finally, we pipe it to `docker volume rm`:

    $ docker volume ls -f dangling=true -q | awk '$0 ~ "^[0-9a-f]{64}$"' | xargs docker volume rm

[^simple regex]: Lies. Regular expressions are never simple.

## A Simple Script

I keep a simple cleanup script named [*docker-cleanup*][docker-cleanup] on my *PATH*, consisting of those three lines. I run it whenever I find myself squinting at the output of `docker ps` or `docker images`, trying to find the item I want. It doesn't just keep my system clean, but my mind too.

    #!/usr/bin/env zsh

    set -e

    echo 'Removing exited processes...'
    docker ps --filter=status=exited --quiet | xargs docker rm

    echo 'Removing dangling images...'
    docker images --filter=dangling=true --quiet | xargs docker rmi

    echo 'Removing dangling, unnamed volumes...'
    docker volume ls --filter=dangling=true --quiet | awk '$0 ~ "^[0-9a-f]{64}$"' | xargs docker volume rm

    echo 'Your Docker is now sparkling.'

I don't think it's stable enough to publish, but if you want to hang onto it, I won't stop you.
