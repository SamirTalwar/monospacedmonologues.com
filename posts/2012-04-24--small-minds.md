I had the opportunity on Sunday to help mentor kids at a one-off
CoderDojo in Shoreditch. After a head count, we realised we had as many
mentors as kids, so we got to pair up one-on-one. After drawing straws
to find out who was going to help the eight-year-old boy with deploying
a PHP and MySQL webapp—not one of us could remember how on earth PHP
worked—we sat down and got cracking.

This was the first time Noah, my assigned mentee, had done anything that
required hacking out text—he was more used to a Microsoft drag-and-drop
game designer called Kodu. I thought that after playing with graphical
stuff, he might find HTML and CSS a bit boring, but after getting over
his initial shyness, he was really enthusiastic about it. We spent some
time going through the basics, and for a short time, he struggled to get
to grips with the concept of text that changed the way other text
worked, but before long we were embedding YouTube videos and linking
everything together.

There’s a certain class of questions that are only asked by children and
newbies. They’re pretty valuable. They usually start with “Why”, and
often follow a “What”. Things like, ‘What does `<a>` mean?’ ‘Er, why is
it called “anchor”?’ After we’ve been working in the field for more than
a few months, let alone a few years, we often forget to ask the
obvious—something I’ll be tackling in my next post.

It’s a wonderful feeling when you meet a 10 year old who’s really
interested in *anything*. When they’re interested in the same field as
you, that’s just a bonus. I was so glad to meet Noah and find out what
made him tick, and I’m looking forward to seeing him again and
discovering how his website has developed in the mean time [at a future
CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.com/). I really encourage anyone with a
passion for their craft to sign up and help teach small kids how this
stuff works.
