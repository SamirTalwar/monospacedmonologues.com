title: "Too Much Work In Progress"

I'm working on a side project to help with a common problem: doing too much at once. I strongly believe that a productive team tries to focus on one thing at a time, and that juggling several pieces of work is the sign of an overloaded, badly-managed or underperforming team.

To figure out useful proxy metrics for too much "work in progress", I surveyed people on Twitter and the [Software Craftsmanship Slack][] to find out how they measure it. Here's my distilled results.

  * Too many branches, including local, non-pushed branches.
  * Too many open pull requests.
  * No movement on work in review (which may be pull requests).
  * Too many tasks in progress (perhaps measured as a multiple of the number of people).
  * Too many tasks in the backlog.
  * One face on too many tasks.
  * Too many unresolved issues/bugs.
  * Failing builds.
  * Failing deployments.
  * Too many builds in progress.
  * Too many commits since the last release to staging/production.
  * Informal comment-based protocols for merging pull requests—a voting protocol could help.
  * Increased one-on-one chatter over instant messaging.
  * A rushed atmosphere during breaks.
  * Size of commits—number of branches, number of lines changed, etc.
  * Time between commits.
  * No visible progress each day.
  * Large amounts of context switching.
  * The number of hours worked increases.
  * Many people off-sick.

For now, I'm just looking at the top two or three, but I hope I can factor most, if not all of these into the project and help teams whittle down their work in progress.
