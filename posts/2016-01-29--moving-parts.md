# Moving Parts

This week, I tried to explain the difference as I see it between object-oriented and functional programming. There are four articles. If you haven't seen them yet, they're linked right here:

  1. [Getters, Setters and Properties][]
  2. [Why Couple Data to Behaviour?][]
  3. [The Other Trade-off: Separating Data and Behaviour][]
  3. [Referential Transparency, And The True Meaning Of Functional Programming][]

[Getters, Setters and Properties]: http://monospacedmonologues.com/post/138009972532/getters-setters-and-properties
[Why Couple Data to Behaviour?]: http://monospacedmonologues.com/post/138076164433/why-couple-data-to-behaviour
[The Other Trade-off: Separating Data and Behaviour]: http://monospacedmonologues.com/post/138140507048/the-other-trade-off-separating-data-and-behaviour
[Referential Transparency, And The True Meaning Of Functional Programming]: http://monospacedmonologues.com/post/138204666541/referential-transparency-and-the-true-meaning-of

But perhaps Michael Feathers said it best.

> OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.
